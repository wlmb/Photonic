=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the macroscopic longitudinal dielectric function for a
given fixed Photonic::...::Haydock structure as a function of the
dielectric functions of the components.

The consuming class needs to supply these methods to inform lazy-building
of C<epsL>:

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item * haydock

The ...::Haydock structure

=item * epsL

The longitudinal macroscopic function calculated from the parameters (lazy-built).

=item * nh

The maximum number of Haydock coefficients to use (required).

=item * nhActual

The actual number of Haydock coefficients used in the calculation

=item * converged

Flags that the last calculation converged before using up all coefficients

=item * smallE

Criteria of convergence for continued fraction. 0 means don't
check.
(defaults to 1e-7)
