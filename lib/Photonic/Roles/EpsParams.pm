=head1 SYNOPSIS

   package Photonic::MyPackage;
   use Moose;
   with 'Photonic::Roles::EpsParams;
   has 'myfield' => (is=>'ro');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object fields that have been factored as they are common in different
Photonic subpackages to calculate the macroscopic dielectric function.

=head1 ACCESSORS (read only)

=head2 nh

Desired no. of Haydock coefficients

=head2 smallH

Convergence criterium for calculations of Haydock coefficients. Default is 1e-7.

=head2 smallE

Convergence criterium for field calculations using Haydock coefficient use. Default is 1e-7.

=head2 epsA

Dielectric function of host

=head2 epsB

Dielectric function of inclusions

=head2 u

Spectral variable
