=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Photonic::WE::R2::Metric;
    my $gGG=Photonic::WE::R2::Metric->new(
            geometry=>$geometry, epsilon=>$eps,
            wavenumber => $q, wavevector=>k);
    f($gGG->value);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the retarded metric tensor g_{GG'}^{ij} for use in the
calculation of the retarded Haydock coefficients for the wave
equation.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(geometry=>$g, epsilon=>$e, wavenumber=>$q, wavevector=>$k);

Create a new Ph::WE::R2::Metric object with Geometry $g, dielectric
function of the reference $e, vacuum wavenumber $q=omega/c  and wavevector
$k. $q and $k are real.
