=head1 DESCRIPTION

Role for classes that calculate the macroscopic dielectric tensor for a
given fixed Photonic::Geometry structure as a function of the dielectric
functions of the components.

The consuming class needs to supply these methods to inform lazy-building
of C<haydock> and C<epsL>:

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item * geometry

L<Photonic::Geometry> describing the structure

=item * nh

Maximum number of Haydock coefficients to use.

=item * smallH and smallE

Criteria of convergence (default 1e-7) for the Haydock coefficients and
the tensor calculations.
0 means don't check.
    *Check last remark*

=item * keepStates

Flag to keep states in Haydock calculations (default 0)

=item * haydock

Array of L<Photonic::Role::Haydock> structures, one for each direction
(lazy-built from geometry if not given). Since this is expensive, once
calculated you are encouraged to use the accessor to pass the value to
construct other C<EpsTensor> with different epsilon.

=item * epsL

Array of L<Photonic::Role::EpsL> structures, one for each direction
(lazy-built if not given).

=item * epsTensor

The macroscopic dielectric function for a given value of the
dielectric functions of the host epsA and the particle epsB, calculated
from previous two parameters.

=item * nh

The maximum number of Haydock coefficients to use.

=item * converged

Flags that the last calculation converged before using up all coefficients
