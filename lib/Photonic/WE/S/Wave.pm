=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Photonic::WE::S::Wave;
   my $W=Photonic::WE::S::Wave->new(metric=>$m, nh=>$nh);
   my $WaveTensor=$W->evaluate($epsB);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the macroscopic wave operator for a given fixed
Photonic::WE::S::Metric structure as a function of the dielectric
functions of the components.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(metric=>$m, nh=>$nh, smallH=>$smallH, smallE=>$smallE, keepStates=>$k)

Initializes the structure.

$m Photonic::WE::S::Metric describing the structure and some parametres.

$nh is the maximum number of Haydock coefficients to use.

$smallH and $smallE are the criteria of convergence (default 1e-7) for
Haydock coefficients and for continued fraction.

$k is a flag to keep states in Haydock calculations (default 0)

=item * evaluate($epsB)

Returns the macroscopic wave operator for a given value of the
dielectric functions of the particle $epsB. The host's
response $epsA is taken from the metric.
