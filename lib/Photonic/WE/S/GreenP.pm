=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Photonic::WE::S::GreenP;
   my $green=Photonic::WE::S::GreenP->new(haydock=>$h, nh=>$nh);
   my $greenProjection=$green->Gpp;
   my $WaveProjection=$green->waveOperator;
   my $EpsTensor=$green->epsilon;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the dielectric function for a given fixed
L<Photonic::WE::S::Haydock> structure as a function of the dielectric
functions of the components.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item * haydock

The L<Photonic::WE::S::Haydock> structure (required).

=item * nh

The maximum number of Haydock coefficients to use.

=item * smallE

Criteria of convergence. 0 means don't check. (defaults to 1e-7)

=item * u

The spectral variable used in the calculation

=item * nhActual

The actual number of Haydock coefficients used in the calculation

=item * converged

Flags that the calculation converged before using up all coefficients

=item * waveOperator

The macroscopic wave operator calculated from the metric.

NOTE: Only works along principal directions, as it treats Green's
function as scalar.

=item * epsilon

The macroscopic dielectric projection

NOTE: Only works for polarizations along principal directions.
