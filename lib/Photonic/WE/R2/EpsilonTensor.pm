=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Photonic::WE::R2::EpsilonTensor;
   my $epsT=Photonic::WE::R2::EpsilonTensor->new(metric=>$m, nh=>$nh);
   my $EpsTensor=$W->evaluate($epsB);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the macroscopic dielectric tensor for a given fixed
Photonic::WE::R2::Metric structure as a function of the dielectric
functions of the components.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(metric=>$m, nh=>$nh, smallE=>$smallE, smallH=>$smallH,
keepStates=>$k)

Initializes the structure.

$m Photonic::WE::R2::Metric describing the structure and some parametres.

$nh is the maximum number of Haydock coefficients to use.

$smallH and $smallE are the criteria of convergence (default 1e-7) for
Haydock coefficients and for the continued fraction.

$k is a flag to keep states in Haydock calculations (default 0)

=item * evaluate($epsB)

Returns the macroscopic dielectric tensor for a given value of the
dielectric function of the particle $epsB. The host's
response $epsA is taken from the metric.
