=head1 DESCRIPTION

Iterates the calculation of Haydock coefficients and states in the
retarded regime and saves them for later retrieval.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(metric=>$m, polarization=>$p, nh=>$nh[, keepStates=>$k, smallH=>$s])

Initializes an Ph::WE::R2::AllH object. $m is the retarded metric to use,
$p is the polarization of the field, $nh is the maximum number of desired
coefficients to calculate, $k is a flag, non zero to save the Haydock
states, $s is a number to be considered negligible. Other arguments
are as in Photonic::WE::R2::OneH.

=item * run

Runs the iteration to completion.

=item * All the Photonic::WE::R2::OneH methods

=back

=head1 ACCESSORS (read only)
