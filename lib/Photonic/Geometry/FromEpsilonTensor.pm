=head1 NAME

Photonic::Geometry::FromEpsilon

=head1 VERSION

version 0.024

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Photonic::Geometry::FromEpsilon;
     $g=Photonic::Geometry::FromEpsilon->new(epsilon=>$pdl);
     $epsilon=$g->epsilon;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a geometry object to be used in a Photonic
calculation from a dielectric function which specifies
a complex dielectric function for each pixel or voxel within the unit
cell.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(epsilon=>$pdl[, L=>$L])

Creates a new Ph::G::FromEpsilon object

$pdl is a nx,ny,nz complex pdl whose value is the complex dielectric function for
each point (nx,ny,nz) within the unit cell. The number
of dimensions of its real and imaginary parts are the dimension of
space, and each dimension is the number of voxels of the unit cell along the
corresponding direction.

$L is the size of the unit cell along the cartesian axes. By
default, it is the number of voxels or pixels.

=head1 ACCESSORS (read only)

=over 4

=item * B

The characteristic function as a PDL. Note: this is not the true
characteristic function, but just a PDL with the appropriate shape.

=item * epsilon

The dielectric function as PDL

=item * L

Unit cell sizes as a B->ndims pdl.
