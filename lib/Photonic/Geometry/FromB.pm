=head1 NAME

Photonic::Geometry::FromB

=head1 VERSION

version 0.024

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Photonic::Geometry::FromB;
     my $g=Photonic::Geometry::FromB->new(B=>$pdl);
     my $B=$g->B;
     my $G=$g->G;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a geometry object to be used in a Photonic
calculation from a characteristic function B. B is a pdl that takes
the values 0 for each pixel or voxel within material A and 1 within
material B.

Consumes L<Photonic::Roles::Geometry>. Please see it for attributes.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * new(B=>$pdl[, L=>$L] [,units=>$units])

Creates a new Ph::G::FromB object

$L is the size of the unit cell along the cartesian axes. By
default, it is the number of pixels.

$units is an ndarray with the directions of the basis vectors of the
lattice. $units(i,n) is the i-th coordinate of the n-th basis
vector. By default, it is given by the cartesian directions.

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 B

Characteristic function: a boolean array with 1's and 0's representing
the characteristic function within the unit cell. Its dimensions must
be odd. Its number of dimensions is the dimension of space
