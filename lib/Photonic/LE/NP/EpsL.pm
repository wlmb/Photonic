=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Photonic::LE::NP::EpsL;
   my $eps=Photonic::LE::NP::EpsL->new(haydock=>$nr, nh=>$nh);
   my $epsilonLongitudinal=$eps->epsL;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the macroscopic longitudinal dielectric function for a given fixed
Photonic::LE::NP::Haydock structure as a function of the dielectric
functions of the components.

Consumes L<Photonic::Roles::EpsL>
