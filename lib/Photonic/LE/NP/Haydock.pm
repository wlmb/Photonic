=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Photonic::LE::NP::Haydock;
    my $nr=Photonic::LE::NP::Haydock->new(epsilon=>$epsilon,
           geometry=>$geometry);
    $nr->iterate;
    say $nr->iteration;
    say $nr->current_a;
    say $nr->next_b2;
    my $state=$nr->next_state;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements calculation of Haydock coefficients and Haydock states for
the calculation of the non retarded dielectric function of arbitrary
periodic many component systems in arbitrary number of dimentions. One
Haydock coefficient at a time. The starting state is homogenous.

Warning: this module is fragile and depends on a particular initial state.

Consumes L<Photonic::Roles::Haydock>, L<Photonic::Roles::EpsFromGeometry>
- please see those for attributes.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES SUPPLIED FOR ROLE

These are provided for roles:

=over 4

=item * geometry

A L<Photonic::Types/GeometryG0> object defining the geometry of the system,
the characteristic function and the direction of the G=0 vector. Required.

=item * B ndims dims r G GNorm L scale f

Accessors handled by geometry (see L<Photonic::Geometry>)

=item * applyOperator

Apply the 'Hamiltonian' operator to state $psi_G in reciprocal
space. State is nx:ny...  The operator is the
longitudinal projection of the dielectric function

=item * innerProduct

Returns the inner (Euclidean) product between states $left and $right.

=item * magnitude

Returns the magnitude of state $psi_G in reciprocal space by taking the
square root of the inner product of the state with itself.

=item * changesign

Returns zero, as there is no need to change sign.

=item * complexCoeffs

Haydock coefficients are complex
