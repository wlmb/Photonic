=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Photonic::LE::NR2::EpsL;
   my $eps=Photonic::LE::NR2::EpsL->new(haydock=>$haydock, nh=>$nh);
   my $epsilonLongitudinal=$eps->epsL;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculates the macroscopic longitudinal dielectric function for a given fixed
Photonic::LE::NR2::Haydock structure as a function of the dielectric
functions of the components. Nonretarded calculation for binary metamaterials.

Consumes L<Photonic::Roles::EpsL>
- please see those for attributes.
