=head1 SYNOPSYS

     use Photonic::Iterator qw(iterator nextval);
     sub makeiterator {
         my $a=shift;
         my $n=0;
         my $it = iterator {
              return $a->[$n++];
         };
         return $it;
     }
     sub makebiterator { #blessed version
         my $a=shift;
         my $n=0;
         my $it=Photonic::Iterator->new(sub {
              return $a->[$n++];
         });
         return $it;
     }
     my @a=(1..100);
     my $it=makeiterator(\@a);
     my $bit=makebiterator(\@a);
     while(my $x=nextval($it)){
        #do something with $x
     }
     while(my $x=$bit->nextval){
        #do something with $x
     }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Facilitate the creation of iterators. Iterators are objects that
produce data items, one at a time, until depleted. They are
implemented as functions (closures) that have state (implemented as
lexical variables) to know which is the next item. The example above
creates an iterator for walking over the elements of an array
reference. The method or function nextval produces the next element if
available or undef when there is no more data. Used in Photonic to
iterate over Haydock states without caring whether they are stored in
an array or in an external file.

=head1 EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item iterator

    my $i=iterator {...}

creates an iterator from the function {...}

=item new

   my $it=Photonic::Iterator->new(sub {...});

creates a blessed iterator from the function sub {...}

=item nextval

   my $x=nextval($i)
   my $x=$i->nextval

returns the next value from iterator $i. The second form works for
blessed iterators, so you don't have to import the function nextval.
